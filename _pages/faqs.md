### Who Are We?

The Erie Bears is an Old School playgroup based out of Erie, PA dedicated to three things:

1. Being an inclusive community for all interested individuals
2. Showing an appreciation for the greater community
3. Slamming some hot jank

### What's Old School?

Old School is a format where the players use cards from 1993 to 1994, in [our current ruleset][1] this means from Alpha to Fallen Empires, in (usually) a traditional 60-card deck. Some formats within Old School, examples being Alpha 40 or OS-EDH, may change what cards are allowed but follow suit by using the older cards. Events are held for the community alongside the enjoyment of the players, commonly doing things like [donating money to good causes][2] both in their local area or on a wider scale.

### Is Old School expensive?

Power Nine cards may be nice but you don't need them at all to have a good time. The Erie Bears was founded by three broke college students which should speak for itself.

### I'm interested, what do I do?

Feel free to get in contact with us through any of our social media links as we would be glad to help, answer any questions you may have, and have you at our next meetup or event!

### Do you have a deck I could use?

At the moment our members only have their one personal deck but this will change over time.

### Why the Erie Bears?

1. [Grizzly Bears][3] is a cool card
2. Bears, both Brown and Black, are local to the area. One of our members has tons of stories of frustration entirely caused by these fuzzy things.
3. No other card seemed fitting to the area.
