## Three Months Later...

Well, not a ton has happened yet. Members are scattered, in-person games are rough, and interest is a meme. More stuff has been done, Jerry got himself a nice mono black list and Andrew built out a WB Cyclopean Tomb deck which was quickly dismantled as certain cards were needed for OS-EDH, but still no big games. Now three months in, it was decided that running a nice proper event may be a good way to get the ball rolling.

**Welcome to The First Challenge!**


### Date 
26th of September, 2020
### Time
Rounds will start at 2PM. Please be early so we can go over rules, answer questions, and make sure you're in the bracket! Rounds will go on until a first place can be determined, so prepare to stay a while if things go long.
### Structure
Swiss pairings (Round Robin if not enough registrants) with 50 minutes per-round. A 10 to 15-minute intermission will be provided between rounds for food, bathroom breaks, conversing, etc.
