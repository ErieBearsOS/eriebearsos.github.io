## Three Months Later...

Well, not a ton has happened yet. Members are scattered, in-person games are rough, and interest is a meme. More stuff has been done, Jerry got himself a nice mono black list and Andrew built out a WB Cyclopean Tomb deck which was quickly dismantled as certain cards were needed for OS-EDH, but still no big games. Now three months in, it was decided that running a nice proper event may be a good way to get the ball rolling.

**Welcome to The First Challenge!**
