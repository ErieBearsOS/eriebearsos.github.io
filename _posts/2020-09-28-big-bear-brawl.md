Sure we're coming right off of last event, but why not go for another? The last was a ton of fun! Still though, doing another plain 93/94 event seems too simple...

### Welcome to Big Bear Brawl*!

### Format
[Old School Brawl](https://sentineloldschoolmtg.com/old-school-brawl-a-93-94-commander-variant/)

---

### Date & Time
The event will be held digitally via our Discord server on **October 24th** starting at **1PM EST**.

---

### Structure
* Players will be seperated into 4-man pods
* Games will be held in Round Robin fashion, each player playing a best-of-one game against their opponent, until they've played everyone else in their pod
* The winners of each pod will be placed in one final (possibly) multiplayer match with placement determined by the order in which players are knocked out.

Games will be in 1v1 fashion on a 50-minute time limit. Any game that goes past this time will be moved to turns with the highest life total determining the winner. Ties post-Turns will be solved by Orb flip-off.

Odd numbers of players and incomplete pods will be solved the morning of the event by Andrew.

---

### Participant Cap
Up to **16** players may enter this event.

---

### Proxies & Reprints
All 59 cards in the main deck may be proxied however you like.

The "commander" card **must** be a real Old School-legal copy. If you can't get a copy or it costs too much then a gold-border blank with hand-drawn proxy/artist proof/artist sketch is also considered acceptable. Printed proxies of the "commander" card will **instantly** disqualify your deck from the tournament!

All reprints with the same original card art and frame, such as a Chronicles *Nicol Bolas* or a Timeshifted *Psionic Blast*, are allowed as we follow Eternal Central reprint rules.

---

### B&R & House Rule
As-mentioned above, we will be following the standard *and* recommended Banned List shown on the Sentinel Old School page. This means that players may not play **City in a Bottle, Karakas, Library of Alexandria, Ancestral Recall, Braingeyser,** or **Mind Twist** in their deck. All other cards are allowed, we won't be adding any more bans.

**House Rule:** All *Bands with other Legends* lands may also be tapped for the one mana of the color they represent.

---

### Decklists
Decklists must be submitted in the form of a **photo and title**, similar to those on our [Decks](https://eriebearsos.com/decks/) page, the day before the event.

---

### Prize
All players who participate will get a free 3ED *Grizzly Bears* and an additional "event card" (random stuff from Andrew's collection) signed by various EBOS members. In addition, there will be things for placement:

**1st:** 1x Alpha *Grizzly Bears*

**2nd:** 1x Beta *Grizzly Bears* + 1x Surprise

**3rd:** 5x Unlimited lands (1 of each Basic) + 1x Surprise

**Spiciest Deck:** Big Surprise!
