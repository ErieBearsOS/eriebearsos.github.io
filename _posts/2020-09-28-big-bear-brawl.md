Sure we're coming right off of last event, but why not go for another? The last was a ton of fun! Still though, doing another plain 93/94 event seems too simple...

### Welcome to Big Bear Brawl*!

### Format
[Old School Brawl](https://sentineloldschoolmtg.com/old-school-brawl-a-93-94-commander-variant/)

**TL;DR:**

* 59 card singleton with one "Commander" card,
* All cards in the main deck must follow the color identity of the "Commander",
* There is no sideboard,
* Players start at **20** life,
* *Ring of Ma'ruf* is legal and may fetch any Old School Brawl-legal card not already in the deck

Do know that the *Recommended Banned List* **will** be used!

---

### Date & Time
The event will be held on **October 24th** starting at **1PM**.

---

### Structure
Players will be seperated into 4-man pods and will play games in a Round Robin fashion, playing a best-of-one with 50 minutes, until they've played everyone else in their pod.

An odd number of registered players will be solved before the event with the organizer (Andrew) dropping if nessecary.

The winners of each pod will be placed in one final (possibly) multiplayer match with placement determined by the order in which people are knocked out.

---

### Participant Cap
Up to **16** players may enter in this event.

---

### Proxies & Reprints
Up to all 59 cards in the main deck may be proxied however you like. 

You **must** own an Old School legal copy or hand-made (with some amount of color and on a gold-border blank) proxy of your commander card. Printed proxies of your commander will instantly disqualify your deck from play!

All reprints with the same original card art and frame, such as a Chronicles *Nicol Bolas* or a Timeshifted *Psionic Blast*, are allowed as we follow Eternal Central reprint rules.

---

### B&R
As-mentioned above, we will be following the standard *and* recommended Banned List shown on the Sentinel Old School page. This means that players may not play **City in a Bottle, Karakas, Library of Alexandria, Ancestral Recall, Braingeyser,** or **Mind Twist** in their deck. All other cards are allowed, we won't be adding any more bans.

---

### Decklists
Decklists must be submitted in the form of a **photo and title**, similar to those on our [Decks](https://eriebearsos.com/decks/) page, the day before the event.

---

### Prize
All players who participate will get a free 3ED *Grizzle Bears* and an additional "event card" (random stuff from Andrew's collection) signed by various EBOS members. In addition, there will be things for placement:

**1st:** 1x Alpha *Grizzly Bears*

**2nd:** 1x Beta *Grizzly Bears*

**3rd:** 1x Collector's Edition *Grizzly Bears*

**Spiciest Deck:** 1x *Chronicles Booster Pack*

### Entry Fee
The event is free for anyone to enter!
