**Welcome to (Name TBD)!**

Right off of last event, why not go for another? Thing is, doing another plain 93/94 event seems too easy so we're switching it up.

### Format
[Old School Brawl](https://sentineloldschoolmtg.com/old-school-brawl-a-93-94-commander-variant/)

The *Recommended Banned List* will be used, all B&R will be listed again below for reference.

### Date
TBD, **most likely around October 24th**

### Structure
Most likely **round robin**, the number of rounds depending on the amount of players.

### Participant Cap
Up to **24 players** may participate.

### Proxies
Cards in the main deck may be proxied but you must own a true Old School legal copy of your "commander" card. Reprints with the same card art and frame, such as a Chronicles *Nicol Bolas* are allowed as we follow Eternal Central reprint rules.

### Entry Fee
TBD, most likely **free** but possibly a **$5** charity donation.

### Decklists
Decklists must be submitted in the form of a **photo and title**, similar to those on our [Decks](https://eriebearsos.com/decks/) page, the day before the event.

### Prize
All players who participate will get an "event card" signed by EBOS members.

**Full prize support TBD.**
