Sure we're coming right off of last event, but why not go for another? The last was a ton of fun! Still though, doing another plain 93/94 event seems too simple...

### Welcome to Big Bear Brawl!

### Format
[Old School Brawl](https://sentineloldschoolmtg.com/old-school-brawl-a-93-94-commander-variant/)

Do know that the *Recommended Banned List* will be used!

### Date
TBD, but the event will most likely around **October 24th.** Expect an update within the week.

### Structure
**Round Robin** with players seperated into 4-player pods (if enough attendees). The winners of each pod will face off in one final match.

### Participant Cap
Up to **24 players** may participate.

### Proxies & Reprints
Cards in the main deck may be proxied but you **must** own an Old School legal copy or hand-made, with color on gold-border blank, proxy of your "commander" card.

All reprints with the same card art and frame, such as a Chronicles *Nicol Bolas* or a Timeshifted *Psionic Blast*, are allowed as we follow Eternal Central reprint rules.

### B&R
As-mentioned above, we will be following the standard *and* recommended Banned List shown on the Sentinel Old School page. This means that players may not play **City in a Bottle, Karakas, Library of Alexandria, Ancestral Recall, Braingeyser,** or **Mind Twist** in their deck. All other cards are allowed, we won't be adding any more bans.

### Entry Fee
All players 

### Decklists
Decklists must be submitted in the form of a **photo and title**, similar to those on our [Decks](https://eriebearsos.com/decks/) page, the day before the event.

### Prize
All players who participate will get a free 3ED *Grizzle Bears* and an additional "event card" (random stuff from Andrew's collection) signed by various EBOS members. In addition, there will be things for placement:

**1st:** 1x Alpha *Grizzly Bears*

**2nd:** 1x Beta *Grizzly Bears*

**3rd:** 1x Collector's Edition *Grizzly Bears*

**Spiciest Deck:** 1x *Chronicles Booster Pack*
