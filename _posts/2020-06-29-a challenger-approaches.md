*A bored college student who helped organize a trip to MagicFest Cleveland with three friends is trying to find events which appeal to him while there. He doesn't much care for Modern, his draft record is absolutely horrible at 12 wins to 622 losses, and he dislikes EDH after playing it through the entirety of high school. After a bit of looking around online he finds* [a tweet][1] *from a group called the* **Cleveland Rocs** *talking about "Old School MTG". He decides after looking into it to buy a deck, White Weenie copied just about exactly from* [the baltimoreoldschool page][2]*, and sign up for whatever this "Old School" is.*
