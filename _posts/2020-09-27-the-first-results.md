**On September 26th, 2020, starting at 2PM, we ran our first event.**

Why run the event? Well, to be entirely honest, I just wanted to get a few good games in. That's about it.

A "sign-up" form went out, I shouted the event out a few times in the Discord server for the game club I'm (somewhat) a part of from school, and after a few weeks we had a solid eight people sign up to play. We allowed full-proxy lists but only with two pieces of the Power Nine and followed Atlantic B&R. Everything was held digitally (except for one game as three of the players were roommates who could just use their table for it) through our Discord server, just a three-round Swiss that way it didn't run too long but everyone got to see some different decks, and it went a lot smoother than I would've expected.

### Prizes

Everyone who participated got a few freebie cards, notably a player-signed 3ED Grizzly Bears "event card" and a second random signed card.

1st got an Antiquities **Strip Mine**,

2nd got an Alpha **Gray Ogre** and **Hurloon Minotaur**,

and 3rd got four Antiquities **Millstone**s.

The spiciest deck got a pack of **Fallen Empires** (which was opened on-stream by request) and also gets a mystery alter,

And finally the person with the best play got an Unlimited **Karma** and World Championship **Land Tax**.

### Results

I won my own event, something I was trying to not do. Oops.

Due to this I shifted all the prizes down so I didn't get anything - 2nd became 1st, 3rd became 2nd, and 4th became 3rd.

**Spiciest Deck** ended up going to Caleb for bringing an all-Antiquities deck that even included the card to hose itself.

**Best Play** went to Chris landing a killer opening hand which made a game on-turns get decided before it ever became a time issue.

Also, due to a decision to give Caleb the Millstones because of how much he loves Antiquities, Chris got an alternate 3rd-place prize featuring an Unlimited **False Orders**, a Japanese Chronicles **Arcades Sabboth**, and an Unlimited **Black Vise**.

With how well that went, everyone seemed to have a great time, we plan on running another event sometime next month. We're not sure how open it'll be, that's to figure out later, but 93/94 Brawl seems like quite the fun thing to try...
