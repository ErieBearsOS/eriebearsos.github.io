### Some Months Later...

Well, the Big Bear Brawl didn't work out. That's a-ok though, we can always run another event! 

**Welcome to the Christmas(ish) Clash!**

*Event Image TBD*

### Date:
*TBD*, I'm thinking in that gap between Christmas and New Year's or a weekend after the start of 2021? Talk with me, I want to know when works for you!

### Time:
*TBD*

### Structure:
Swiss Pairings if we can do so, Round Robin if we can't.

### Participant Cap:
Up to 24 Participants.

### Format:
[Atlantic 93/94](https://sentineloldschoolmtg.com/atlantic-93-94/) with all reprints that follow the same card art and frame as their original printing allowed (Eternal Central/American reprint policy).

**Proxies and other playtest cards are allowed**, decks may even be full-proxy if you don't own any old school cards, but players may only have **up to two Power Nine proxies per-deck.** Please try to keep them as old school as possible, avoid modern/alt. arts and play the originals!

### Play Method:
We'll be doing webcam games via [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fDdeJj5) so make sure all of your cards are readable across a webcam!

### Entry Fee
This event is **free** for anyone to enter! If you would like to make a donation of *TBD* to *TBD* then you'll also be entered for a raffle!

### Decklists
Submit your decklist in the form of a **title and completed photo**, similar to those on the [Decks](/decks/) page, in the **decklists** channel of [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fDdeJj5) before 11:59PM on *TBD* 

No, we **do not** accept tappedout or other online deck generator links, we want a photo of your spread for the event report.

### Prize
We do have full prize support!

* 1st Place - TBD + Bonus Alter!

* 2nd Place - TBD + Bonus Alter!

* 3rd Place - Alpha *Grizzly Bears* + Bonus Alter!

All players who provide their address in the sign-up form will also recieve a free club card - an EBOS-signed Unlimited *Grizzly Bears* - which can be brought to future events for possible bonuses and signatures!

As-mentioned all players who prodide proof of a *TBD* donation to *TBD* will be entered in a raffle for a special prize worth a bit more than 1st place!
