### Some Months Later...

Well, the Big Bear Brawl didn't work out. Oh well. That's a-ok though, we can always run another event! 

**Welcome to the Christmas(ish) Clash!**

### Date:
~~At the moment we're looking at **January 16th, 2021** but can run a week earlier or later if needed.~~
We'll be moving the event back a week or two due to conflict with other ongoing events. Check back in a bit or view the announcement we'll post in our Discord server!

### Time:
Rounds will start at **1PM** Eastern. Each will go for 50 minutes, games that go over the time limit will be placed onto turns, and a five-minute break will be given between each round.

### Structure:
Swiss Pairings if we can do so, Round Robin if we can't.

### Participant Cap:
Up to 24 Participants may enter.

### Format:
[Atlantic 93/94](https://sentineloldschoolmtg.com/atlantic-93-94/) with all reprints that follow the same card art and frame as their original printing allowed (Eternal Central/American reprint policy).

**Proxies and other playtest cards are allowed**, decks may even be full-proxy if you don't own any old school cards, but players may only have **up to two Power Nine proxies per-deck.** Please try to keep all proxies as old school as possible, avoid modern/alt. arts and play the originals!

### Play Method:
We'll be doing webcam games via [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fDdeJj5) so make sure all of your cards are readable across a webcam!

### Entry Fee
This event is **free** for anyone to enter!

### Decklists
Submit your decklist in the form of a **title and completed photo**, similar to those on the [Decks](/decks/) page, in the **decklists** channel of [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/fDdeJj5) before 11:59PM on Friday, January 15th. 

No, we **do not** accept tappedout or other online deck generator links, we want a photo of your spread for the event report.

### Prize
We do have full prize support!

* 1st Place - *Surprise Card*

* 2nd Place - ATQ *Strip Mine* + Bonus!

* 3rd Place - LEA *Grizzly Bears* + Bonus!
